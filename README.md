# android-kotlin-nav-template

Use this project as a template for your next Android Kotlin app.

I built this app to practice Kotlin and to try and emulate an iOS app for a company I applied to in February 2018.

### What it does:
 1. OkHttp web request for [JSON](http://www.gamermessenger.com/savorlyapp/food_feed.json)
 2. Create custom objects using google-gson
 3. Use Picasso to load images from URL located inside JSON
 4. Use CircleImageView to make some images look nice
 5. List meals using a RecyclerView
 6. Send meal data to "Meal Detail Activity" using intents
